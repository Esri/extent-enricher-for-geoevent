# Processor Definition
PROCESSOR_LABEL=Geometry Extent Enricher Processor
PROCESSOR_DESC=Enriches GeoEvents with the geometry's Extent (bounding box) as GeoEvent Attributes (MinX, MinY, MaxX, MaxY). Note: for points, MinX = MaxX and MinY = MaxY.
PROCESSOR_GED_NAME_LBL=New GeoEvent Definition Name
PROCESSOR_GED_NAME_DESC=Enter a name for the new GeoEvent Definition. If a name is entered, a new GeoEvent Definition will be created regardless of whether the output geometry field is an existing geometry field or not. If a name is not entered and the output geometry field is a new field, a new GeoEvent Definition will be created with a unique name.
PROCESSOR_ADD_CENTER_PT_LBL=Include Center Point ?
PROCESSOR_ADD_CENTER_PT_DESC=Include the center point of the geometry as part of the field enrichment. If so, a new field of type GEOMETRY named CenterPoint will be added to the event.
